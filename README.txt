corrs.py is the main program, and was written to find correlations between different aspects from a large csv of apartment data across the U.S.
corrs.py uses pyspark and pandas in order to do these operations
when run, corrs.py should show the correlations between number bedrooms and the price of an apartment, number of bathrooms and the price of an apartment, and square footage and the price of an apartment.
corrs.py should also show the U.S. states with the highest and lowest average apartment prices as well as those average price values


datacleaning.py is a program that was written and run in order to clean the data from the original apartments.csv file to remove extraneous data and missing values
this program uses the pandas package, and creates a new csv file of the cleaned data

The other files are the original apartments.csv(this file ended up being too large to upload to github, but the link to the file in google drive will be added in the report) file and the csv file with cleaned data called apartmentsclean.csv
